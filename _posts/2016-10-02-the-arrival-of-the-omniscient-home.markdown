Most people are treating the 2nd-gen Amazon Echo Dot as just another product refresh. Here's why they're wrong, and it actually means much, much more.

The original Amazon Echo was expensive, clocking in at $180, although it was paired with a passable Bluetooth speaker. Amazon later lopped off the top of the Echo, and sold it as the Echo Dot for $90. The Echo Dot had a built-in speaker (although it was tinny), but, more importantly, it contained the identical far-field microphone array that its larger sibling carried.

If you've attempted to address your smartphone from across the room, you'd have run into one of the more fundamental design limitations of smartphones today: their microphone array (yes, it is more than one microphone on most phones today) is designed to _isolate_ you, the speaker, when you are near your device to the intentional detriment of noise that's further away. Phones, then, specialize in _near-field_ listening.

This is why interacting with the Echo Dot is so refreshing. It's not because Alexa is better than Siri or Google Now (it isn't, yet). It's because you don't have to yell or repeat yourself (too often), even when you're across the room. Amazon is so confident in its far-field technology that it makes available an audio clip of your every interaction with Alexa, so you can assess just how accurate its microphone array is, both in the face of surrounding noise (like a television), as well as distance from the Dot.

The second killer feature is integration with Samsung SmartThings, one of the leading providers of home automation today. SmartThings works with a wide array of light switches, wall plugs, door locks and thermostats, so you can get a mostly-automated home with a dozen or so Things connected to your Hub. Getting Alexa to _see_ your devices is as simple as saying "Alexa, discover". Alexa can then make your home reasonably responsive to your whims. Everything from turning on the kettle or kitchen lights, to setting the temperature, is as easy as a natural-language voice command.

In a sense, Amazon's Echo makes SmartThings a more usable product that SmartThings ever was.

People are deriding Amazon's decision to sell a six-pack (and a twelve-pack) of the Echo Dot as excessive consumerism, and that no one should really want or need an Echo in every room of the house. They're missing the point entirely.

At $250, you can get your entire house to listen to you. The Dot has been up
