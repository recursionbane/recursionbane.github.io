So much of programming revolves around using the latest and greatest technologies to design (and often _redesign_) applications. Or so the web would have you believe.

If you've designed a system of any complexity in an enterprise environment, however, you'd understand how the goals are often completely inverted. Over there, in the nether-realm, new (i.e. __unproven__) is generally regarded as _bad_, and with good reason. The progress slider is dragged nearly all the way from "innovative" to "stable". New, even transformative ideas are welcomed, but are accepted when they manifest as well-wrought programs that show you have anticipated multiple workflows using your concept.

Enterprise doesn't want a buggy product today with infinite future potential. They want a functioning solution today with a roadmap of extensibility. The concept of a minimum viable product carries little weight, because updates to code in a production environment are infrequent. As an extreme example, you may get a chance to publish major (non-bugfix) updates once a quarter, and woe betide you if you upend user expectations in interface or behavior with your update.

Lately, there has been more vocal feelings among certain talented engineers that they are somehow misfits in the industry. They may feel this way for a variety of reasons: unwillingness to move fast and break things, the inability to focus on a coding sprint by putting aside the big-picture view, or baffled by the assessment of self-worth based on number of code commits.

Do not be disheartened. Considered thought, flexibility in planning and robust commits are highly valuable skills in enterprise. Keep your chin up, and reevaluate your choice of employer before you bury your passion.
